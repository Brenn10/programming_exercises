# Sorts

I decided I wanted to figure out and implement all of the major sorting algorithms. The ones covered in this folder are below with brief overviews ( I definitely did not go to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) to find these).

* Simple sorts
  * Insertion sort
  * Selection sort
* Efficient sorts
  * Merge sort
  * Heapsort
  * Quicksort
* Bubble sort and variants
  * Bubble sort - TODO
  * Shellsort - TODO
  * Comb sort - TODO
* Distribution sort
  * Counting sort - TODO
  * Bucket sort - TODO
  * Radix sort - TODO
