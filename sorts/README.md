# Sorts

I decided I wanted to figure out and implement all of the major sorting algorithms. The ones covered in this folder are below with brief overviews ( I definitely did not go to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) to find these).

* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Merge sort
* Heapsort
* Quicksort
* Bubble sort
* Comb sort
* Radix sort

Implementations complete:
  cpp
